## About the LRE Package

This tool estimates loads using a generalised rating curve approach with
uncertainties.

## Installation

You can install a development version of the LRE package from
[GitHub](https://github.com/pkuhnert/VizU)

    # install.packages("devtools")
    devtools::install_github(repo = "pkuhnert/LRE", build_vignettes = TRUE, force = TRUE)

## LRE Methodology

We have developed a statistical methodology for estimating pollutant
loads with uncertainties. The approach is regression based and
incorporates a four step process:

1.  Methods for flow regularisation to correct for sampling bias,

2.  Statistical model for concentration

3.  The load calculated at regular time intervals, and

4.  An estimate of the uncertainty in the loads estimate.

The statistical model incorporates terms for flow, and other
characteristics of flow (e.g.Â rising or falling limb or flow history),
in an attempt to mimic some of the hydrological phenomena observed in
these complex systems, while two different sources of uncertainties are
captured by the model to address error in the concentration samples and
error in the flow measurements. The regression approach is flexible and
can be shown to encompass other existing load estimation methods such as
the average estimators.

## Examples

A vignette for the LRE package is available and contains examples
relating to loads estimation for the Burdekin and Tully end of catchment
sites.
